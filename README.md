# Electrical Service Design of a 9-Floored Building

## Overview

This project involves the design of the electrical systems for a 9-floor building. The primary goal is to ensure the efficient, safe, and reliable distribution of electrical power throughout the building. The project covers various electrical services, including power distribution, lighting, and emergency systems, tailored to the specific needs of each floor.

## Features

* **Power Distribution**: Design of electrical panels, breakers, transformers, and wiring to ensure proper power distribution.
* **Lighting Systems**: Detailed design of lighting for common areas, offices, and emergency lighting.
* **Emergency Power Systems**: Design of backup power solutions to ensure continuous operation in case of power failures.
* **Circuit Sizing**: Accurate sizing of circuits for safety and efficiency.
* **Energy Efficiency**: Considerations for minimizing energy consumption and promoting sustainability.

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can view the electrical design in the provided diagrams and calculations. These files may include schematics for the entire building's electrical layout, including floor-wise distribution, lighting systems, and emergency backup systems. You can edit or modify these designs as necessary to fit the needs of your specific project or building.
