# BNBC Compliant Electrical Service Design of a 9-Storeyed Building

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **electrical service design** for a **9-storeyed residential/commercial building** in compliance with the **Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC)**. The objective is to ensure safe, efficient, and code-compliant electrical distribution throughout the entire building, covering everything from power supply to protection systems.

## Scope of Work

The project includes the following components:

* **Load Estimation**: Detailed calculation of power demand for each floor and the entire building.
* **Transformer Sizing**: Selection and sizing of transformer(s) based on total load requirements.
* **Cable Sizing and Selection**: Appropriately sized cables for feeders and sub-feeders, taking into account voltage drop and current-carrying capacity.
* **Protection Devices**: Determination and placement of MCBs, MCCBs, and ELCBs according to circuit requirements and safety standards.
* **Distribution Board (DB) Design**: Layout and configuration of main distribution board (MDB) and sub-distribution boards (SDBs) for each floor.
* **Wiring Layout**: Floor-wise wiring plan including lighting, socket outlets, and heavy-duty appliance circuits.
* **Earthing System**: Design and implementation of an earthing system compliant with BNBC safety regulations.
* **AutoCAD Layouts and Schematic Diagrams**: Visual representation of the electrical system through technical drawings.

## Standards and Compliance

* **BNBC (Bangladesh National Building Code)** – All designs strictly adhere to the electrical section of BNBC.
* **IEC Standards** – Used where BNBC is silent, particularly for cable sizing and protection coordination.

## Tools & Software Used

* **AutoCAD** – For electrical layout diagrams and schematics.
* **Microsoft Excel** – Load calculations and data tabulation.
* **Manual Calculations** – For verification and BNBC-based computation.

## Outcome

The resulting design ensures:

* Optimal power distribution.
* Electrical safety and protection.
* Regulatory compliance.
* Practical implementability on-site.

## Authors & Contributions

This project was prepared as part of an academic or professional exercise in electrical engineering, focusing on real-world implementation and compliance with national codes.
