# Electrical Service Design of a 9-Floored Building

## Overview

This project involves the design of the electrical systems for a 9-floor building. The primary goal is to ensure the efficient, safe, and reliable distribution of electrical power throughout the building. The project covers various electrical services, including power distribution, lighting, and emergency systems, tailored to the specific needs of each floor.

## Features

* **Power Distribution**: Design of electrical panels, breakers, transformers, and wiring to ensure proper power distribution.
* **Lighting Systems**: Detailed design of lighting for common areas, offices, and emergency lighting.
* **Emergency Power Systems**: Design of backup power solutions to ensure continuous operation in case of power failures.
* **Circuit Sizing**: Accurate sizing of circuits for safety and efficiency.
* **Energy Efficiency**: Considerations for minimizing energy consumption and promoting sustainability.
